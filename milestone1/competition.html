        <p>
            I personally don't think there is much competition, in terms of websites. I'm competing with people, I'm not
            competing websites. I will have an edge over the competition by working hard and creating great things, and
            this website is merely a medium to present them. That being said, I can take inspitation from other
            sites. I really like Audemars Piguet's website. It presents their beautiful things but is still easy to use.
            I also like how in Telha Clarke's website if you scroll down a bit at the home page it shows their
            biggest projects.
