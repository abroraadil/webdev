        <p>
            My audience will be colleges, possible employers, and prospective clients. They will most likely be located
            around the US, but maybe if I want to go study abroad they'd be in Europe or East Asia. I have no idea what
            the age ranges would be, probably from ~25-~70. The gender of the audience should be roughly evenly split.
