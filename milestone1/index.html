            Website Summary
        </h2>
        <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
        <p>It will contain pictures, videos, and descriptions of my projects. Smaller projects and art will get
            pictures, and big projects will get their own page.</p>
        <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site (ie. images & text)?</h4>
        <p>I will record it myself and write it myself.</p>
        <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
        <p>If someone is thinking of accepting me, they will care because it shows my abilities</p>
        <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
        <p>So that I can influence what they think of me. If they search up my name this should hopefully be the first
            to pop up and it should "tint their glasses."</p>
        <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
        <p>See my stuff</p>
        <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
        <p>To make myself look good</p>
